# NiFi Component Inventory

This directory tracks processors, controller services, reporting tasks, and other NiFi components that require explicit handling in the automation tool. The goal is to maintain a visible checklist of components, their key behaviors, and any special implementation requirements.

## Structure
- `processors-implemented.md` – processors already handled by the automation, with links back to the candidate entries.
- `processors-candidate.md` – full list discovered from the NiFi source tree (auto-generated).
- `controller-services-implemented.md` / `controller-services-candidate.md` – analogous structure for controller services.
- Future files for reporting tasks, parameter providers, etc., as needed.

## How to Populate the Lists
Candidate lists are generated by scanning the NiFi source tree (e.g., `nifi-extension-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java`) for classes that implement processor/controller interfaces. No NiFi instance is required to build these inventories. If you wish to enrich the tables with additional metadata (e.g., bundle coordinates, property descriptors), you can either parse the source annotations/POMs or query a live NiFi REST API for runtime descriptors—those follow-up steps are optional.

## Implementation Notes
- "Implemented" lists should reflect processors/services with explicit logic in the CLI (e.g., auto-termination handling, controller-service provisioning). Update status and notes as features land.
- Candidate tables can be enriched with metadata such as bundle coordinates (group/artifact/version), source module, property count/required properties, and key relationships once metadata extraction scripts are in place.
- “Candidate” lists are generated from the source tree to capture the universe of components. Mark items as implemented by moving entries (or referencing the candidate row) when they gain support.
- Link back to source code or NiFi docs when useful.
- Use tables with columns such as `Type`, `Bundle`, `Key Properties`, `Relationships`, `Notes`.

## Next Steps
1. Generate the full list of standard NiFi 2.x processors and populate `processors.md` with at least bundle coordinates and relationships.
2. Repeat for controller services in `controller-services.md`.
3. Highlight processors/services that the current automation already supports or requires bespoke logic.
