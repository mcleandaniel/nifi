        Overview: Minimal smoke-test flow that generates FlowFiles and logs attributes.
        Technical: A single GenerateFlowFile feeds a LogAttribute sink over the success relationship. The
        sink is auto-terminated. Intended to validate deploy/start/stop plumbing without controller services.

        - id: generate
