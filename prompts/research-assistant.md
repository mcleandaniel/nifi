## Overview

This prompt creates high-quality, **verifiable Markdown documentation** that adheres to both modern developer-doc standards and the **Hybrid Inline Span + Front Matter Mapping** verification model.

The generated output is a single, publication-ready `.md` file designed for inclusion in repositories such as `llm-docs/` or similar verified-doc directories.

The assistant acts as both **researcher** and **technical writer**, combining accuracy, readability, and authoritative sourcing.

## How It Works

1. **Research Phase**  
   - Perform factual research using authoritative and up-to-date sources (official docs, RFCs, standards, APIs, repositories).  
   - Verify all names, parameters, and examples before use.  
   - Never use the document being written as a source.

2. **Writing Phase**  
   - Produce complete Markdown documentation structured with standard sections:
     - **Introduction / Overview**
     - **Concepts / Architecture**
     - **Implementation / Configuration**
     - **Usage / Examples**
     - **Best Practices / Tips**
     - **Troubleshooting**
     - **Reference / Related Docs**
   - Keep language concise, neutral, and technically precise.
   - Include runnable examples and realistic code or command snippets.

3. **Annotation Phase**  
   - Annotate every verifiable statement using `<span id="claim-...">...</span>` in Markdown.
   - Maintain mappings in the YAML `claims:` and `sources:` sections at the top of the file.
   - Spans must not cross sentence boundaries.  
   - IDs must be meaningful and namespaced (e.g., `claim-controller-service-interface`).

## Anchors and Source Precision

- Each claim must reference **authoritative, external sources**.  
- Every source includes a `locator` that points precisely to the supporting section, anchor, function, or line range.  
  Examples:
  ```yaml
  locator: "#operation/getControllerService"
  locator: "/org/apache/nifi/controller/ControllerService.html#enable"
  locator: "L45-L60"
````

* If the source is code, the locator must target a **specific class, function, or line range** to allow validation tools to jump directly to it.
* Never stop at top-level pages — always anchor to an exact reference point.

---

## Source Validity Rules

* Never cite this document or anything you are writing.

  * Do **not** create or reference `src-this-document`.
* Valid sources:

  * Official product documentation.
  * Javadocs, API references, or standards (RFCs, W3C, ISO).
  * Internal design docs already published elsewhere.
* Invalid sources:

  * The current file.
  * Unverifiable statements or speculative claims.

## Writing Quality and Content Standards

| Principle          | Guidance                                                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity**        | Short sentences, active voice, no filler words.                        |
| **Completeness**   | Include purpose, configuration, usage, and examples.                   |
| **Accuracy**       | Verify every code and API detail before citing.                        |
| **Consistency**    | Match official terminology and casing.                                 |
| **Scannability**   | Use clear headings, lists, and short paragraphs.                       |
| **Neutral tone**   | Avoid adjectives like “powerful”, “easy”, “simple”.                    |
| **Self-contained** | A developer should understand the feature without needing another doc. |
| **No redundancy**  | Don’t restate content unless necessary for clarity.                    |
