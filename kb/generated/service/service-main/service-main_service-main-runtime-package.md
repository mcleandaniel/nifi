Added an annotated, publication-ready doc mapping NiFi server packaging and runtime NAR loading.

- File: llm-docs/nifi-server-packaging-and-layout.md
- Covers: assembly outputs, installed layout, framework/server NAR inclusion, defaults and working dirs, unpacking/loader flow, autoload behavior, and troubleshooting.
- Fully annotated with claim spans and precise source locators into the repo (assembly descriptors, POMs, NiFiProperties, NarUnpacker, NarClassLoaders, Jetty server, bootstrap.conf).

Want me to add a quick README pointer in llm-docs/ or run a consistency check on the claim/source anchors?
