Created a verified, publication‑ready onboarding guide with precise citations.

- File: llm-docs/developer-onboarding-guides.md
- Contents: Environment prerequisites, build steps, run/verify examples, contributor workflows, troubleshooting, and references.
- Verification: Every factual sentence is annotated with a span and mapped to specific line ranges in official NiFi AsciiDoc, AGENTS.md, and automation/README.md.
- Key inclusions:
  - Java 21 requirement, Maven build command with contrib-check, and optional Maven profiles.
  - NAR packaging and nifi-nar-maven-plugin usage with root POM inheritance.
  - Start/stop commands, default credentials, UI URL, and certificate note.
  - Repo’s automation CLI quickstart (venv, install, env vars, CLI commands, tests, integration suite, Docker run) and clean deploy workflow.
  - Agent practices for scripted workflows and focused debugging.

Want me to tailor it for a specific NiFi version or add a quick “first PR checklist”?
