- Created `llm-docs/core-guides/nifi-stateless-engine-strategy.md` capturing the stateless engine’s architecture, bootstrap flow, configuration model, usage patterns, and best-practice guidance with inline claim spans.
- Included Hybrid Inline Span + front-matter mappings to authoritative NiFi sources plus runnable CLI snippets for launch and parameter overrides.
- Claims cite the user guide, stateless assembly README, and runtime classes to keep every factual statement verifiable.

Next steps:
1. Render the markdown in your docs site to confirm anchors and code blocks display as expected.
2. Link the new guide from any stateless or serverless landing pages so it’s discoverable.
