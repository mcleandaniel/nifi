Created a verified, publication-ready Markdown doc with annotated claims and precise source locators.

- File added: llm-docs/security-response-and-disclosure.md
- Sources: SECURITY.md and the authorization subsystem (factory bean, factory, APIs, properties), plus Single User Authorizer and Login Identity Provider classes
- Every verifiable sentence is wrapped in an inline span and mapped to exact file line ranges in the YAML front matter
- Includes sections for Overview, Concepts/Architecture, Implementation/Configuration, Usage/Examples, Best Practices, Troubleshooting, and References
- Examples use command snippets that auto-handle env vars (no manual shell var setup)

Quick highlights
- Vulnerability intake and disclosure process: private reporting channel, PMC triage, ASF policy, and post-release publication channels (mailing lists, CVE, NiFi Security page).
- Authorization framework: how AuthorizerFactoryBean loads authorizers/providers, validates authorizers.xml, installs integrity checks, and injects NiFiProperties.
- Configuration: property names with examples, plus Single User Authorizer pairing with its login provider.
- Troubleshooting: common initialization errors (missing authorizer id, missing/invalid authorizers.xml, duplicate identifiers, Single User mispairing).

Want me to run a quick local linter on the new doc or open a PR-ready commit message?
